### Why Blockchain Development?

Why Clement is so excited about the world of Blockchain/Blockchain Development:

- Up until very recently in the world Web2, we could only created centralized apps
    - Users: When we used a product or service, we had to give/trust a central power that controls the product or service
        - May not seem like a big deal, but it is!
            - The central power can prevent you from using the service, change the terms and conditions, etc., without you having any say in the matter!

            - Example: You lose access to your bank account tomorrow
                - The bank/government says they say suspicious actions
                - You now are no longer able to access it

            - Example: You lose all of your social media followers

            - Example: You lose all of your $ on some centralized exchange
            
            - Example: You are prevented from sending money to another person in another country
                - You may have to deal with outrageous fees

- Web3/Blockchain/Crypto comes in to fix these problems!
    - We can create fully decentralized applications
    - We can also inject some level of decentralization in centralized settings
        - Who people trust in a centralized setting:
            - Government
            - Politician
            - Company
            - Single individual

        - Who people trust in a de-centralized setting:
            - Code
            - Math
            - Cryptography
            - Open-source protocol that anybody has access to

        - This is incredibly impactful!
            - To add on, there is an economic shift
                - We can incentivize user participation in a network, by providing the users with tokens that appreciate once more users join the network
                    - This encourages the members of the community to get others to join 
                        - The cycle continues

Clement's final opinion: This is a transformative paradigm!
- As transformative as Web2/Internet 20-25 years ago
- The most exciting role to play in Blockchain: Builder
    - This is where BlockchainExpert comes in!

BlockchainExpert: Going 0 to 100 in the world of Blockchain Development in 1 place.

    - etc.

One thing to notice: Everything in BlockchainExpert is on 1 page!

Note: This is a living product - it will continue to grow and develop, so these videos could end up being a bit outdated with current features.

Core Features/Lessons:
1. Introduction
2. Blockchain Fundamentals
3. Ethereum And Smart Contracts
4. Solidity Fundamentals
5. Advanced Solidity
6. Interacting With Smart Contracts
7. Web3 Tools
8. Projects

One thing to note - Each lesson has the following:
- Time estimate (time to watch video content AND finish practice questions)
- Number of videos
- Number of practice questions

Let's take a look at an Example Lesson - Blockchain Fundamentals:
- Left-hand side: Progress in the Lessons
- Middle: Content
    - Each Lesson has the following:
        - video
        - key terms
        - practice questions

Now that we have seen a Lesson, let's look at a practice question. Scroll down and click 'Test Yourself'

We are given a few questions, which you can go through with the Prev/Next buttons.
- Right now: Multiple Choice
- Later on: Coding Workspace

After you click through all of the questions, you will automatically go to the next Lesson.

Next, let's look at an assessment question, which is below Lessons on the main page.
- These are more challenging
    - You only want to look at these once you actually finish the assessment

- You can write and test all code on this screen
    - No need for IDE's or any outside coding!

Last big feature - Projects!

These projects will teach you the following:
- How to Write a Smart Contract
- How to Deploy a Smart Contract
- How to Test a Smart Contract
- How to Write a Frontend (that lets you interact with the contract)
