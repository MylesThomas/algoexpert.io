# Instructions

Long story short: I realized I wanted to organize my files differently when I was already pretty far into this project.

I want each crash course to have their own folder.

Example paths: 
- /notes/figures/html/0.png
- /notes/figures/css/23.png

Steps to fix my issue: 

1. Create a python file in the same folder as the .png files that need their name changes
- ie. /notes/figures/css

1. Change into the directory of that file in VSCode

1. Run the file: python script-to-change-filenames.py
